                    <h1>Artificial Intelligence Pt.2: Apple, Inc.</h1>

                <p>Continuing with our artificial intelligence series, we will now focus on one of the largest, and often, most controversial companies in Apple, Inc. Apple is a hard company to figure out. Like all Fortune 500 companies, Apple has released great products along with bad products. The kicker with Apple is that while its products can be almost downright awful (the Newton, Macintosh TV), its top products have been revolutionary. From the Lisa to the Macintosh, the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, Apple was seemingly unstoppable in creating products that revolutionized the way we looked at personal tech. Lately, however, Apple’s astonishing streak of groundbreaking products is slowing. It hasn’t stopped, surely, but past and present Apple enthusiasts have scratched their head when asked what Apple’s next moves should be... </p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence is the next big thing. It is no longer sci-fi but a tangible reality which is affecting business and the economy, albeit on a limited scale. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, along with others, are already in a corporate arms race to create the next big thing in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Much like the booming growth of the internet in the 90’s, artificial intelligence will improve lives, productivity in                 business processes, and concurrently the economy in obvious ways, but also in ways that we can’t yet imagine. So where does the average investor not only fit in, but benefit from this? We will discuss where artificial intelligence will make a sizable impact, and the companies that will have a hand in that change.
                First, some disclaimers. AI is not what it is depicted in Hollywood or popular video games. Computers are dumb and people are smart, especially people who construct hardware systems and program software...</p>
