            <p>This is the first ever website that I made. It was for an web development introductory class that taught basic HTML/CSS and Javascript.
            The goal was to make a site that sold some type of product. As can be seen, the product in question for my site was skateboards and complimentary products.
            The pages consist of a home, shop for products, relavent skateboarding news, a forum for interactions between skateboarders and fans and a contact page to
            contact the owners of the online store. I chose skateboarding because I used to love the sport and spent a lot of time working on that craft.
            In time, I will probably update this page just for fun; but for now it is a nice reminder of where I have come in my web development practice.</p>

            <p>This is another webpage made from an intrductory web development class. Its mainly focused on an efficient and telling style representing what
                the company (in this case Pacific Trails Resort) is trying to convey to the customer. The style is supposed to indicate a calming and relaxful atmosphere.
                The page layout is simple to make the information more presentable to any user. On the Yurts page, there is a styled table. On the activities page,
                there is a small demonstration of an interactive image gallery. Just hover over the pictures to view. The reservations page presents a form.
